## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control helps keep the code updated and the timeline also that the code was changed.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Go to projects then use the add button to create a new repository and decisions that need to be made while creating a repository is to consider if the project is to be public or private.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
Details description of the project should be indicated in the read me file include guideline on what the code should achive and further credentials if there is any for accessing the project while running on a server.It contributes to effective collaboration since for every update there is update on the read me file through the version control.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Public repository can be accessed by anyone while private can only be accessed when given permission through authentification like password.Advantage of public repository is that collaboration and contribution can be done by anyone unlike private repository.

How to create a first commit is through Creating a new branch git checkout -b branchname and they help in keeping track and changes pull request.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Select the current current branch and merge into current branch incase of conflict in merging github will give an error

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
Pull request is used to comapare changes in the existing code and the current code that is uploaded through the pull request.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking helps in collaboration of projects through making changes in code and creating pull request it differs from cloning as cloning it is just downloading the entire project folder to make changes in the editor
## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
Github limits the maximum file size one can add to a repository its only upto 50MB. It can be solved allocated a larger storage disk space under freemium
